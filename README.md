This is my project in web development, where I created a simple website to display a list of movies without using API integration. This project only uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎬 Features
- Main page with a static list of movies
- Responsive design with simple CSS
- Interactive effects using basic JavaScript
- Easy-to-understand code structure for beginners

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- AOS (Animate On Scroll)

## 📂 Project Structure
```
📁 movie-website
 ├── 📄 index.html  # Main page
 ├── 📄 styles.css  # CSS styling
 └── 📁 src  # Folder for images and other media
```

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your computer:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Orchidezss/movies-website.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser.
3. Enjoy this simple movie website!

## 🎯 Notes
This project was created as an initial exercise in frontend web development. Future plans may include adding more features such as movie search, category filters, or API integration to fetch movie data dynamically.
